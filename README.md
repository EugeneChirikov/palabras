Universal tool for translation and learning new words which can use dictionaries in **sqlite database** format.
The intention was to parse different dictionary formats into **sqlite**. Parser is a separate programm and for the moment supports only **stardict**. Application aims users who can't go online to translate words.

We had big plans for this application, but we don't have much time for this now.
